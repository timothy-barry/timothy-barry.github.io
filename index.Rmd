I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard University, advised by [Xihong Lin](https://content.sph.harvard.edu/xlin/index.html). Previously, I obtained my PhD in Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University under the joint supervision of [Kathryn Roeder](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~roeder/) and [Eugene Katsevich](https://ekatsevi.github.io). My research focuses on coupling simple, principled, and fast statistical methods to emerging technologies in genomics and computer science, such as CRISPR genome editing, single-cell sequencing, and big data processing systems. Much of this work is motivated by the goal of understanding the role noncoding genetic variation in human disease. I am especially interested in the following areas.
:::

-   **Statistics**: independence and conditional independence testing, robust methods, measurement error.

-   **Genomics**: CRISPR experiments, in particular single-cell CRISPR screens.

-   **Computing**: data structures and algorithms for scalable single-cell analysis, clouds and clusters, large language models. (I am currently a novice in the latter technology!)
