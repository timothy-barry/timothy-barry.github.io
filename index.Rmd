I like to work in the connective tissue that binds together the allied sciences of statistics, computing, and genomics.

I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). I am advised jointly by Professors [Kathryn Roeder](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~roeder/) (CMU) and [Gene Katsevich](https://ekatsevi.github.io) (University of Pennsylvania). Previously, I studied math and computer science at the University of Maryland, College Park. My interests intersect statistics, computer science, and genomics:

**Statistics**: regression methodology, selective inference \
**Computing**: large data, clouds and clusters, out-of-core algorithms \
**Genomics**: applications to CRISPR genome editing, single-cell sequencing
