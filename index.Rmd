I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).  I am fortunate to be advised by Professors [Kathryn Roeder](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~roeder/) (CMU) and [Gene Katsevich](https://ekatsevi.github.io) (University of Pennsylvania). I like to work within the connective tissue that binds together the allied sciences of statistics, computing, and genomics. My interests are as follows:

**Statistics**: regression methodology, selective inference \
**Computing**: large data, clouds and clusters, out-of-core algorithms \
**Genomics**: applications to CRISPR genome editing, single-cell sequencing

I was a visiting student at the University of Pennsylvania over the summer of 2022, generously hosted by my co-adviser Gene.
