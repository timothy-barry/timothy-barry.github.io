I am a postdoctoral researcher at Boston Children's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital, advised by Dan Bauer, Luca Pinello, and Danilo Pellin. I obtained my PhD in Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University. I like to work within the connective tissue that binds together the statistical, biological, and computational sciences. I am especially interested in the following areas.

:::
-   **Genomics**: CRISPR screening and profiling experiments

-   **Statistics**: conditional independence testing, multiple testing

-   **Computing**: efficient algorithms for genomics, clouds and clusters
