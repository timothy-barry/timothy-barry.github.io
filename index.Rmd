I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard University, advised by [Xihong Lin](https://content.sph.harvard.edu/xlin/index.html). Previously, I obtained my PhD in Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University under the joint supervision of [Kathryn Roeder](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~roeder/) and [Eugene Katsevich](https://ekatsevi.github.io). I like to work within the connective tissue that binds together the statistical, biological, and computational sciences. I am especially interested in the following areas.

:::

-   Statistics: independence and conditional independence testing, robust methods, measurement error

-   Genomics: CRISPR experiments, in particular single-cell CRISPR screens

-   Computing: data structures and algorithms for large-scale single-cell analysis, clouds and clusters
