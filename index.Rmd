I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard University, advised by Xihong Lin. Previously, I obtained my PhD in Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University under the joint supervision of Kathryn Roeder and Eugene Katsevich. I like to work within the connective tissue that binds together the statistical, biological, and computational sciences. I am especially interested in the following areas.

:::

-   Statistics: independence and conditional independence testing, multiple testing

-   Genomics: single-cell genomics, CRISPR experiments

-   Computing: clouds and clusters, efficient algorithms for genomics

Additionally, I increasingly am interested in exploring how emerging deep learning models can be leveraged to predict the effect of unseen genetic perturbations or interventions. Feel free to shoot me an email at tbarry@hsph.harvard.edu. Also, here is my [CV](ResumeCv/cv.pdf).
