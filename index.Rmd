I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by Professors [Kathryn Roeder](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~roeder/) and [Gene Katsevich](https://ekatsevi.github.io). Previously, I studied math and computer science at the University of Maryland, College Park. My interests are at the intersection of statistics, computer science, and genomics. I work on statistical methods and computational algorithms for the analysis of data produced by new genomic technologies. I am especially interested in problems arising from single-cell regulatory CRISPR screens and large-scale single-cell sequencing data.
