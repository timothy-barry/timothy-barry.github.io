I am a postdoctoral researcher at Boston Children's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital, advised by Dan Bauer, Luca Pinello, and Danilo Pellin. I obtained my PhD in Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University. I work in statistical genomics, with a focus on statistical problems arising in CRISPR screen analysis and CRISPR therapeutic development. 

Methodologically, I am interested in independence and conditional independence testing, multiple testing, efficient algorithms for genomics, and (more recently) deep learning.
