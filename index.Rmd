I am a fifth-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).  I am fortunate to be advised by Professors [Kathryn Roeder](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~roeder/) (CMU) and [Gene Katsevich](https://ekatsevi.github.io) (University of Pennsylvania). Previously, I studied math and computer science at the University of Maryland, College Park. I like to work within the connective tissue that binds together the allied sciences of statistics, genomics, and computing. My current interests are as follows. **Statistics**: robust inference, regression methodology; **Genomics**: single-cell CRISPR screens; **Computing**: large data, clouds, clusters.

Here are my [email](email.html), [Github](https://github.com/Timothy-Barry), and [CV](ResumeCv/timsResume.pdf). I am excited to chat/work with biologists; do shoot an email or open a Github issue to get in touch.
