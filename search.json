I am advised jointly by Professors Kathryn Roeder (CMU) and Gene Katsevich (University of Pennsylvania). Previously, I studied math and computer science at the University of Maryland, College Park. My interests intersect statistics, computer science, and genomics:\nStatistics: regression methodology, selective inferenceComputing: large data, clouds and clusters, out-of-core algorithmsGenomics: applications to CRISPR genome editing, single-cell sequencing\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n",
